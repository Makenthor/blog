# Project Documentation: Sample File

This file serves as a random example of various Markdown formatting options.

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as possible.

---

## 1. Text Formatting

You can easily format text to add emphasis:

*   This text is *italic* or _italic_.
*   This text is **bold** or __bold__.
*   This text is ***bold and italic***.
*   This text includes a ~~strikethrough~~.

## 2. Lists

### Unordered List
Use hyphens, asterisks, or plus signs.

- First item in an unordered list.
- Another item.
  - Nested item (indent with two spaces).
  - Another nested item.
- Back to the main list.

### Ordered List
Use numbers followed by periods. The actual numbers used don't matter, as the rendering engine will order them correctly.

1.  First step.
2.  Next step.
3.  Third step.

## 3. Links and Images

*   **Link:** [Visit the Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
*   **Image:** ![Alt text describing the image](https://example.com/logo.png "Optional Title")

## 4. Blockquotes

Use the `>` symbol for blockquotes.

> This is a blockquote. It's often used to highlight quotes or important information.
> 
> > This is a nested blockquote.

## 5. Code

### Inline Code
Wrap code within single backticks (`):

Use the `printf()` function in C.

### Code Block
Wrap a block of code with triple backticks (```) for syntax highlighting (e.g., `md` for Markdown or `python` for Python).

```python
def fibonacci(number):
  if number <= 1:
    return number
  else:
    return fibonacci(number - 1) + fibonacci(number - 2)

print("The 8th Fibonacci number is:", fibonacci(8))
```

## 6. Tables

Tables use pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`) to define columns and headers.
