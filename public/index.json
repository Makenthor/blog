The goal: write notes in Obsidian, mirror them into Hugo, and host everything automatically on GitHub Pages. What I Installed (Windows)\r#\rInstalled Hugo prebuilt binaries by following this guide:\nHugo Installation on Windows Installed Hugo in C:\\Program Files\\Hugo Added the Hugo path to Environment Variables → User Variables → Path Creating a New Hugo Site\r#\rCreated a new Hugo site in the folder:\nC:\\Own_Space\\blog Run this command: hugo new site blog Then inside the site folder (blog):\ngit init git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish Configure the Theme\r#\rDeleted the hugo.toml file created by Hugo.\nCopied the config files from the theme into the site folder.\nEdited the following files:\nhugo.toml\nlanguages.en.toml\nparams.toml\nCustomized the menus and other options in menus.en.toml.\nRun Hugo Locally\r#\rUsed this command to start the server: hugo server --disableFastRender --noHTTPCache This runs the site locally so I can preview all changes. Mirror Notes from Obsidian to Hugo\r#\rTo sync my notes from Obsidian into Hugo’s content/Blog folder, I used this command: robocopy \u0026#34;C:\\Own_Space\\Second_Brain\\Makenthor Lab\\Blog\u0026#34; \u0026#34;C:\\Own_Space\\blog\\content\\Blog\u0026#34; /mir /mir keeps both folders mirrored, deleting and adding files as needed. Deploying to GitHub Pages\r#\rFollowed this guide: Blowfish Hosting \u0026amp; Deployment\nCreated a new file: .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\nAdded the following code:\n# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages on: # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch push: branches: [\u0026#34;master\u0026#34;] # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab workflow_dispatch: # Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages permissions: contents: read pages: write id-token: write # Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued. # However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete. concurrency: group: \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34; cancel-in-progress: false # Default to bash defaults: run: shell: bash jobs: # Build job build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest env: HUGO_VERSION: 0.152.2 steps: - name: Install Hugo CLI run: | wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb - name: Install Dart Sass run: sudo snap install dart-sass - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: recursive - name: Setup Pages id: pages uses: actions/configure-pages@v5 - name: Install Node.js dependencies run: \u0026#34;[[ -f package-lock.json || -f npm-shrinkwrap.json ]] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npm ci || true\u0026#34; - name: Build with Hugo env: HUGO_CACHEDIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo_cache HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production run: | hugo \\ --minify \\ --baseURL \u0026#34;${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/\u0026#34; - name: Upload artifact uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 with: path: ./public # Deployment job deploy: environment: name: github-pages url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }} runs-on: ubuntu-latest needs: build steps: - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages id: deployment uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4 Useful Links\r#\rBuild your homepage using Blowfish and Hugo\nGetting Started With Hugo | FREE COURSE\nBuilding a static website in Markdown with Hugo\nI started a blog\u0026hellip;..in 2024 (why you should too)\nHow To Make A Hugo Blowfish Website\nPublish a Static Hugo Website the EASY way // Cloudflare Workers\nurl: https://blog.networkchuck.com/posts/my-insane-blog-pipeline/ title: \u0026#34;My Insane Blog Pipeline\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;Obsidian - Why I love it Obsidian is the BEST notes application in the world.
